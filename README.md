## About
Ocula is a weather app built entirely using modern web standards in an attempt to create a great looking weather app that anyone can use on any device while also providing a simple PWA template for developers to build upon.

I set out to create Ocula as a replacement for my favourite weather app - Pocket Weather, which was unfortunately shut down at the end of 2019 due to high maintenance costs.

## Philosophy
The goal of this project is to satisfy the following:

- Must be open-source and freely available to all.
- Must be ad-free, subscription-free and any revenue generated to be used for ongoing maintenance costs.
- Must be built entirely using free (or freemium) services/assets (including hosting, api's, graphics etc.).
- Must be fast, lightweight, accessible and beautiful.

It is my hope that by satisfying the above conditions Ocula can be a weather app for all to enjoy without being bombarded with ads and signups. 

However, as a result of satisfying the above conditions it is therefore not sustainable without some form of monetisation. For the most part I use free tiers of various services to ensure the app remains free but with increased usage I will personally incur the cost and may be forced to shutdown the service should costs become burdensome. For this reason I ask that you consider one of the following:

- If you like Ocula and use it as your everyday weather app I ask that you please consider contributing a regular small donation to the project (see [donating](#donating)) to help ease the cost of maintenance.
- If you are a developer you are free to fork this repository and host your own copy in accordance with the MIT licence.
